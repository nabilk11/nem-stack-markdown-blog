# nem-stack-markdown-blog
This is a full markdown blog application, using the NEM stack (Node.js, Express, &amp; MongoDB). The frontend UI is being rendered with ejs.


# Markdown
In the vein of this README, the application will accept blogs in the markdown format, using a dependency known as marked.

# Dependencies
I used a series of different modules for this blog application, including the following:
- Express - The framework upon which our application is built and allows us to perform routing etc. 
- Nodemon - Allows for constant updates and continuous running of the application. 
- EJS - Used EJS format in order to render our views for the blog.
- Mongoose - Connection to our MongoDB Atlas Database.
- dotenv - For our .env file
- Marked - Allows us to render the blogs in markdown to html.
- Multer - Will use in the later version of the application in order to give individuals the ability to upload images alongside their blogs.
- Slugify - To allow us to clean up our URLs
